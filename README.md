## FAQ

### How to make menubar's background as transparent?

This is known limitation of WindowServer in macOS. you can send feedback to Apple for future improvement of WindowServer, or you **really** want transparent background of menubar, you can disable SIP and modify WindowServer (but I dont know that works).

Workaround: change black or white background to desktop (in System Preferences) may get better look little a bit.
